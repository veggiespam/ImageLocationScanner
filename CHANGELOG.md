## 1.1 - 2019-02-21
- Your basic corrections of spelling errors in comments when you finally use something besides vim for writing code
- Break out README.md into CONTRIBUTORS.md and CHANGELOG.md - readme was too long
- New IPTC privacy tags leaks detected
- Updated dependencies to Metadata Extractor 2.13.0 & XMP Core 6.0.6 & Burp Extender API v2.1
- Minor speedup in critical path
- Gradle build now targets Java 9 API

## 1.0 - 2018-01-22
- Gradle build automatically downloads the Burp API jar, so no need to include code in Git repo any longer
- Fixed mixed spaces-and-tabs, thanks to ZAP's [@kingthorin](https://github.com/kingthorin)
- Fixed a chance of an image causing HTML-injection inside of Burp; I theorized it existed (maybe a non-Burp app calling ILS would result in full-blown XSS against the infosec tester), but [@pajswigger](https://github.com/pajswigger) from Burp/Portswigger actually exploited this type of injection in the form of `<i>` tags, since Burp rejects `<script>` tags
- Nicer Makefile (sigh, yes, I still use make)
- Enhanced READMEs, FAQs, screenshots, etc
- ZAP now auto-scans images without the need to "un-hide" images
- Lots of unit tests via junit inside of ZAP, [@kingthorin](https://github.com/kingthorin) helped a bit
